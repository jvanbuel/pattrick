# Pattrick

Pattrick is a command line tool for managing Personal Access Tokens (PAT) in Azure DevOps.

It allows you to:

- üê£ create
- üìñ list
- üîé show
- ‚ö∞Ô∏è delete

PATs without having to go to the web interface.

## Installation

On MacOs, you can install Pattrick with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

```bash
brew tap jvanbuel/pattrick
brew install pattrick
```

On Linux, you can install Pattrick by executing the following commands:

```bash
curl -L https://github.com/jvanbuel/pattrick/releases/download/v0.3.0/pattrick-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz | tar xvz
chmod +x pattrick
sudo mv pattrick /usr/local/bin/pattrick
```

## Usage

Pattrick looks for Azure CLI credentials to fetch an access token for authentication with Azure DevOps. If you haven't logged in yet, you can do so with:

```bash
az login
```

## Usage as standalone library

You can also use Pattrick as a standalone library. This is useful if you want to manage PATS programmatically in your own codebase.

```rust
use pattrick::PatManager;

```

Pattrick is a command line tool for managing Personal Access Tokens (PAT) in Azure DevOps.

It allows you to:

- üê£ create
- üìñ list
- üîé show
- ‚ö∞Ô∏è delete

PATs without having to go to the web interface.

## Installation

On MacOs, you can install Pattrick with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

```bash
brew tap jvanbuel/pattrick
brew install pattrick
```

On Linux, you can install Pattrick by executing the following commands:

```bash
curl -L https://github.com/jvanbuel/pattrick/releases/latest/download/pattrick-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz | tar xvz
chmod +x pattrick
sudo mv pattrick /usr/local/bin/pattrick
```

## Usage

Pattrick looks for Azure CLI credentials to fetch an access token for authentication with Azure DevOps. You can get one locally by logging in to Azure with:

```bash
az login
```

If `pattrick` cannot find a valid access token, it will try to log you in automatically (by using the `az login` command under the hood). You can then start using `pattrick` to manage your PAT tokens:

```bash
pattrick create --lifetime 100 --scope Packaging
```

By default, `pattrick` writes newly created token to stdout. However, you can also tell `pattrick` to write the token to your `.netrc` file (useful for e.g. installing Python packages from Azure DevOps Artifacts), or to a local `.env` file:

```bash
pattrick create --out std-out (default) / dot-netrc / dot-env
```

To get an overview of the other commands and options available, run:

```bash
pattrick --help
```

## Usage as standalone library

You can also use Pattrick as a standalone library. This is useful if you want to manage PATS programmatically in your own codebase.

```rust
use pattrick::{PatTokenManager, PatTokenListRequest, DisplayFilterOption};
use pattrick::azure::get_ad_token_for_devops;

let pat_manager = PatTokenManager::new(get_ad_token_for_devops().await?);

let pat_tokens = pat_manager.list_pat_tokens(
     PatTokenListRequest {
        display_filter_option: DisplayFilterOption::All
     }
 ).await?;
```
